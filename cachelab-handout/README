This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab.

Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
    linux> ./test-trans -M 61 -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
    linux> ./driver.py

This directory contains the files that you will need to run the CS:APP
cache lab, which develops the student's understanding of caches.

************
1. Overview
************

In this lab, the student works on two C files called csim.c and
trans.c.  There are two parts: Part (a) involves implementing a cache
simulator in csim.c. Part (b) involves writing a function that
computes the transpose of a given matrix in trans.c, with the goal of
minimizing the number misses on a simulated cache.

Each time a student with login "foo" compiles their work, the Makefile
automatically generates a handin file, called foo-handin.tar, that
contains the csim.c and trans.c file. Students hand this tar file in
to the instructor.

The driver program (driver.py) evaluates the correctness of the cache
simulator in csim.c, and the performance
